        <p>This site is currently under construction, but it is and will be a home for my reviews and some other musings</p>
        <p>I'll eventually have a contact form here, but for now, hit me up on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/schnabeldylan.loreweaversloom.com">Bluesky</a> or email me at this domain, with my first name, Dylan, as the username portion of the email address.</p>
        <h2>An Informative Text Blurb</h2>
										<p>
											All reviews are my own opinions. Sometimes, authors, publishers, or others provide me with a free review copy, either through an e-ARC distribution platform or of their own volition.
											I am deeply grateful for the opportunities to read and review those works, but the availability of those copies does not impact the quality or content of my review.
