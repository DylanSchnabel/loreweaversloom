    <h1 id="review">Review</h1>
    <p>NetGalley and the publisher have my thanks for providing me with a review copy. </p>
    <p>Haunt Sweet Home is a not-so-spooky ghost story set primarily on the set of a haunted house home renovation reality TV show. It has some heart and some laughs, but it falls a bit short of a home run hit. </p>
    <p>Pinsker gives us a main character who is a bit stuck. She&#39;s tried college a few times and a few jobs, but nothing has seemed to work. Of course, this comes to a head at a family gathering where the successful TV show host cousin offers her a job as an assistant on the set of his show. </p>
    <p>This goes pretty normally, honestly, but eventually, things get a little bit weird. This is the primary hook of the book, and honestly, I felt it was one of the weakest. There&#39;s always a delicate line to try and straddle when it comes to introducing an element the reader may guess before the character, and even though everything in this novella has a relatively short page count, I felt the time between the twist becoming a bit obvious and the main character figuring it out drug a bit. </p>
    <p>That being said, the found family vibes in this were pretty solid, and I always appreciate when the born family isn&#39;t despicable in found family stories. </p>
    <p>Overall, if you&#39;re in the mood for a non-spooky-spooky-season book or a quick read that incorporates traditionally scary elements without much scare, this would be a good grab from your library. </p>
