        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>This site is currently under construction, but it is and will be a home for my reviews and some other musings</p>
                                          <p> I read and watch widely, but you'll mostly find SFFH books and short stories, movies of many varieties, and even some television. </P>
                                          <p>I'm far from a professional, but if anything you find here entertains you or helps you in some way, so much the better. Will that happen? Probably not, but who cares! </p>
        <h2>An Informative Text Blurb</h2>
										<p>
											All reviews are my own opinions. Sometimes, authors, publishers, or others provide me with a free review copy, either through an e-ARC distribution platform or of their own volition.
											I am deeply grateful for the opportunities to read and review those works, but the availability of those copies does not impact the quality or content of my review. 
										</p>
